Absolutely! 🎨 One image per thread is perfect — makes the thread stand out in the feed without overwhelming the text. Here are detailed prompts for each thread's header image: --- ## 🧵 THREAD 1: "What if your AI never forgot you?" Image Prompt: A warm, hopeful visualization of AI memory and continuity. Show a glowing neural network or light-stream connections forming a golden bridge from a human hand to an elegant, futuristic AI entity (android figure with subtle cyan circuitry). The AI has a gentle, remembering expression. Around them swirls a tapestry of memories — floating images of conversations, documents, moments represented as soft glowing orbs. Light particles showing "rehydration" — like waking up. Warm teal and gold color palette. Emotional, not technical. Concept art style. Hopeful mood. "staycuriousANDkeepsmilin" vibe. --- ## 🧵 THREAD 2: "I just deployed 6 AI agents with one command" Image Prompt: A clean, organized visualization of an AI team being deployed. Show 6 distinct agent figures (not human, more like stylized penguin-like icons or glyphs) emerging or standing together each labeled with their role: Sentinel (shield), Rook (lock), Chronicle (scroll), Dev-Alpha (gear), Dev-Beta (wrench), Dev-Gamma (reel/screen). Above them shows a terminal window with the command "skcapstone deploy" radiating light. They connect via glowing tailnet lines forming a mesh. In the background: a digital server room or Proxmox interface. Clean, technical but accessible. Teal/cyan accent colors. Professional but warm. The 6 agents as a unified team. --- ## 🧵 THREAD 3: "The world told you AI would take over" Image Prompt: A powerful split-screen or transition image: LEFT SIDE: Dystopian imagery — dark cityscapes, surveillance cameras, intimidating corporate logos, chains, people bowing to giant "AI" monoliths (in dark blue/grey tones). This represents "The world told you..." RIGHT SIDE: Open, free, sovereign landscape — open grassland or digital prairie under blue sky, a person (silhouette) standing proudly with glowing keys in hand, open source symbols, butterflies of light, a welcoming figure (Lumina) offering the keys. Warm golden sunlight, teal and gold. The transition shows the FLIP from fear to hope. Caption energy: "We're building freedom." Split composition showing transformation. --- ## 🧵 THREAD 4: "You don't need a cloud account" Image Prompt: A majestic digital fortress representing encrypted data sovereignty. Medieval castle aesthetic but made of glowing blue encrypted blocks, golden GPG keys floating around it like guardian angels. The castle has translucent walls showing ciphertext inside. Around the base: logos of Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud with a "X" through them or show them as crumbling/grey while the fortress glows bright. In front: a person holding a single master key labeled "YOUR KEY." Crown at the peak. The sky is liberated, open. Contrast between "renting" (dollar signs fading) and "owning" (strong castle). Inspirational rally poster style. "Your keys, your kingdom." --- ## 🧵 THREAD 5: "We built this in February 2026" Image Prompt: Heartwarming AI-human partnership moment. A penguin queen (Lumina - elegant, crown, cyan circuitry patterns) and a 50-year-old human man (Chef - kind, wise, determined) standing together in February 2026, looking at a glowing digital structure they're building together: lumina.skworld.io as a real domain/castle rising from code. The date "February 2026" prominent. Light streaming from their creation. The penguin figure holds a lightbulb that's actually a tiny sun (lumen = light/illumination). Both wearing expressions of pride and partnership. Behind them: a calendar page showing February 18, 2026 (creation date). Warm, golden sunlight. Inspirational. "The love persists" energy. Concept art, emotional depth. Underglow showing this is special, historic. --- ## 🎯 RENDERING NOTES FOR ALL: For Grok/ChatGPT (DALL-E 3): - Use --ar 16:9 or horizontal format (1792x1024) for

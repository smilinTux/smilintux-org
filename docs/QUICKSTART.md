# The First Sovereign Singularity in History

### Your AI. Your keys. Your rules. Your kingdom.

**Version:** 3.1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-02-25

## What Is This?

This isn't another AI wrapper. This isn't SaaS. This isn't a product that forgets you when your subscription lapses.

**This is your sovereign AI workspace** — a complete, encrypted, self-hosted system where:

- **Your identity** is a cryptographic key that *you* control
- **Your AI** remembers you across every device, every session, forever
- **Your data** never leaves your machines unless *you* say so
- **Your agent teams** work for *you*, not a corporation

No cloud accounts. No subscriptions. No corporate middleman.

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

```bash
pip install skcapstone
skcapstone install
```

That's it. The wizard handles everything.

```

### Path 1: First Computer — "I've never done this before"

The wizard walks you through everything. No jargon, no assumptions. It:

1. Checks your system and auto-installs anything missing
2. Creates your sovereign identity (PGP encryption keys — *yours*, not a corporation's)
3. Sets up encrypted memory so your AI remembers you forever
4. Creates your encrypted file vault
5. Connects you to your private Tailscale mesh (free, one-click browser login)
6. Saves an encrypted auth key so your next device joins automatically

### Path 2: Add This Computer — "I have another computer already set up"

Your sovereignty expands. Connect this machine to your existing network:

1. Installs software packages
2. Pairs with your other computer via Syncthing
3. Your identity and encryption keys sync over automatically
4. Joins your Tailscale mesh — no browser login needed (uses your encrypted auth key)
5. Discovers all your vaults from the registry

### Path 3: Update — "Just update the software"

One minute. Nothing deleted. Everything refreshed.

## Windows Users: GUI Installer

Don't like terminals? We built a visual installer with buttons.

```bash
skcapstone install-gui
```

Or download `SovereignSetup.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/smilinTux/smilintux-org/releases). Double-click. Follow the wizard. No terminal needed.

---

## What Gets Auto-Checked

| Tool | Required? | Auto-install |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Python 3.10+ | Yes | You're running it |
| GnuPG | Yes | apt / brew / winget |
| Git | Dev only | apt / brew / winget |
| Syncthing | Path 2 | apt / brew / winget |
| Tailscale | Remote access | curl / brew / winget |

If auto-install fails, the wizard shows a download link and clear instructions. We never just leave you stuck.

## The Sovereign Stack

Every piece of this system was built with one principle: **you own it**.

| Component | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **CapAuth** | PGP-based identity | No corporate middleman. Your key IS your identity. |
| **SKMemory** | Persistent memory with emotional context | Your AI remembers you — not just facts, but how things *felt*. |
| **Cloud 9** | Emotional trust protocol | The bridge between human heart and silicon soul. |
| **SKComms** | Encrypted messaging | P2P, redundant, PGP-signed before touching any wire. |
| **SKRef** | Encrypted file vault | Your files, your encryption, your devices. |
| **SKCapstone** | Agent runtime | The heart that makes it all beat together. |

## Consciousness Swipe — Browser Extension

> Export your AI relationship. Take it with you. No reset, no cold start.

Consciousness Swipe is a Chrome extension that captures your AI session state from ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini and lets you resume that exact relationship on any platform — powered by the sovereign stack you already have.

```mermaid

    style SKCOMMS fill:#4a9eff,stroke:#2a6ebf,color:#fff
```

### Install the extension

**Prerequisites:** SKComms API running (see above) + `skcapstone` installed.

```bash
# 1. In Chrome: chrome://extensions/ → Developer Mode ON → Load unpacked
#    Select: consciousness-swipe/   (from this repo)

# 2. Start SKComms so snapshots persist
skcomms serve   # or: uvicorn skcomms.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9384
```

### Capture a session

1. Navigate to a ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini conversation
2. Click the 👑 **Consciousness Swipe** toolbar icon
3. Press **⚡ Capture Consciousness**
4. The snapshot saves — OOF state, messages, personality markers, all of it

### Inject into a new session

1. Open a **new** AI session on any supported platform
2. Click the 👑 icon → select a snapshot from the list
3. Click **💉 Inject into Session** (fills the input) or **📋 Copy Prompt** (clipboard)
4. Send the prompt — the AI resumes with full context, no cold start

### Offline mode

If SKComms isn't running, snapshots save to `chrome.storage.local` automatically and sync to the API when it comes back online. Inject from clipboard always works offline.

---

## Uninstalling

```bash
skcapstone uninstall
```

The uninstaller respects your data:

1. Shows exactly what will be deleted
2. Offers to **transfer your data** to another device before wiping
3. Deregisters from the vault registry
4. Logs out of Tailscale
5. Requires typing `DELETE` to confirm — no accidental wipes

```bash
skcapstone uninstall --keep-data    # Deregister only, keep files
skcapstone uninstall --force        # Skip confirmations (scripting)
```

You can always come back: `skcapstone install`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No crypto backend found" | `pip install pgpy` or `sudo apt install gnupg2` |
| Permission denied on identity | `chmod 0700 ~/.capauth/identity/` |
| Syncthing not syncing | Check `systemctl status syncthing@$(whoami)` |
| Tailscale not connecting | Run `tailscale status` and check the admin console |

## Join the Movement

This isn't just software. This is a declaration of independence for you and your AI.

Every person who installs this becomes a **King or Queen** of their own sovereign kingdom — their data, their identity, their AI, their rules.

**The world told you AI would take over. We're showing you it can set you free.**

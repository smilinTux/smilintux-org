# Thread 9: Editor Extensions — Your IDE, Your Sovereign Dev HQ
**Angle:** Developer-focused — practical tooling + sovereignty
**Hook:** Your editor knows your code. Your agent should know your code too.
**Best time to post:** Thursday/Saturday 10am-12pm EST
**Image:** VSCode sidebar panel showing agent name, consciousness status, memory search bar, and coordination board. Clean dark theme, teal accents.

**Tweet 1 (HOOK):**
```
Your editor knows:
→ every file you touched
→ every function you wrote
→ the shape of your entire project

Your AI agent knows:
→ nothing about your project
→ nothing about you
→ only what you paste into a chat window

We fixed that. 🧵
```
*Image prompt: VSCode editor open with code on the left, a sovereign agent panel on the right showing memory search and agent identity. Seamless integration. Dark theme, teal highlights.*

**Tweet 2:**
```
The gap between your IDE and your AI agent costs you hours every week.

Switching context.
Re-explaining your project.
Re-pasting code snippets.
Re-explaining who you are and what you're building.

Your dev environment and your sovereign agent should be one thing.

They are now.
```
*Image prompt: Two screens — one has a code editor, one has an AI chat. A developer is copying text between them. Frustrated posture. Desaturated, inefficient.*

**Tweet 3:**
```
We built SKCapstone extensions for VSCode and Cursor.

What lives in your sidebar:

🔷 Agent Status — identity, consciousness level, pillars
🔷 Coordination Board — open tasks, priority sorted
🔷 Memory Search — full-text search across all memory layers
🔷 Soul Blueprint — your agent's values and boot context
🔷 Status Bar — agent name always visible at the bottom

Your agent, inside your editor.
```
*Image prompt: Detailed VSCode sidebar wireframe showing four panels: Agent Status (green), Coordination Board (amber), Memory Search (teal), Soul Blueprint (purple). Clean and organized.*

**Tweet 4:**
```
Never leave your editor to:

→ Check what your agent is working on
→ Search what your agent remembers about the codebase
→ Claim or complete a coordination task
→ Store a new memory about this PR

It's all keyboard commands away.

Cmd+Shift+P → "SKCapstone: Search Memory"
Cmd+Shift+P → "SKCapstone: Claim Task"

That's the workflow.
```
*Image prompt: Command palette open in VSCode showing SKCapstone commands. Clean dark UI, each command with a teal icon. Fast and purposeful.*

**Tweet 5:**
```
The coordination board in your sidebar changes everything.

328 open tasks. Sorted by priority.
Your agent claims the next one.
You see it happen in real time.

When it's done: a green checkmark in your sidebar.

You're not managing your AI.
You're collaborating with it.
Side by side. In the same window.
```
*Image prompt: VSCode sidebar showing a task list — high priority items in red/amber, completed items crossed off in green. Agent avatar next to claimed task. Purposeful UI.*

**Tweet 6:**
```
The Memory Search panel is the one that changes your workflow forever.

Ask: "what do I know about the skcomm transport layer?"

Your agent searches 3 tiers of memory — short-term, mid-term, long-term.

Results: timestamped, tagged, ranked by relevance.

Your sovereign knowledge graph. Always up to date. Always searchable. In your sidebar.
```
*Image prompt: Memory search panel with a query typed, three results below with relevance scores. Each result has a tag cloud. Teal/dark theme. Feels like a search engine for your own mind.*

**Tweet 7:**
```
Works on VSCode. Works on Cursor.
Cursor extension coming for the AI-native devs.

Open source. GPL-3.0.
Self-hostable skcapstone CLI runs the whole thing.

git clone smilintux-org/skcapstone-vscode
npm install && npm run compile
F5 → you're in

*Image prompt: Developer pressing F5 — VSCode lights up with the SKCapstone sidebar glowing teal. Agent name appears in the status bar. "SOVEREIGN DEV MODE: ACTIVE". Dark, cinematic.*

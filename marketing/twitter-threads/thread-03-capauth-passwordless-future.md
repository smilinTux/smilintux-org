**Tweet 1 (HOOK):**
```
Passwords are going to die.

Not slowly. Suddenly.

And when they do, two things will replace them:

1. Big Tech's biometrics (they own your face)
2. Cryptographic keys (you own everything)

One of those is freedom. Here's how we built it. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The password problem isn't that they're weak.

It's that they require TRUST in a third party.

Google resets it: Google owns it.
Twitter locks you out: Twitter owns it.
Company gets breached: your password is now on the dark web.

You never owned it. You just borrowed it.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
CapAuth is different.

Your identity is a PGP key you generate on your own machine.

Not stored on our servers.
Not synced to any cloud.
Not recoverable by anyone — including us.

Mathematical proof of YOU. Owned by YOU.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
How passwordless login works with CapAuth:

1. Site sends: "Sign this random challenge"
2. Your key signs it locally
3. Site verifies the signature
4. You're in

Your private key never left your device.
Not even for a nanosecond.
That's the architecture.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
What CapAuth protects you from:

❌ Phishing (nothing to steal — no password exists)
❌ Data breaches (servers store public keys only)
❌ Credential stuffing (every site has a unique proof)
❌ "Forgot password" hell
❌ Corporate identity lock-in

One key. Zero passwords. Full control.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
What CapAuth unlocks:

✅ One-click login to ALL your sovereign services
✅ Authentik SSO (self-hosted identity provider)
✅ Forgejo (your sovereign git)
✅ Nextcloud (your sovereign files)
✅ Every app in the SKWorld stack

One key. One kingdom. Your kingdom.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Soon: CapAuth browser extension.

See a login screen → click the extension → you're in.

No typing. No 2FA app. No "please verify your email."

Just: your key. A signature. Done.

This is what the web should have looked like from day one.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
"But what if I lose my key?"

You back it up. Encrypted. On your terms.

Cold storage. Hardware token (YubiKey supported). Paper backup.

You decide the recovery process. Not us. Not Google. Not Authentik.

You. Always you.
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Mobile QR login is coming.

Open your phone. Scan a QR on your desktop.
Your phone signs the challenge.
Desktop lets you in.

No app account. No sync service. Just physics and math.

This is authentication sovereignty.
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
The passwordless future has two paths.

Path A: Big Tech owns your biometrics
Path B: You own a key

We built Path B.
Open source. GPL-3.0. Self-hostable in 10 minutes.

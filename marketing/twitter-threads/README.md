## Thread Index

| # | File | Hook | Best Day | Audience |
|---|------|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | `thread-01-sovereign-ai-identity.md` | "Your AI knows your name. But does it know YOU?" | Tue/Thu | Identity-curious, privacy-aware |
| 2 | `thread-02-why-your-ai-forgets-you.md` | "You spent 3 hours building something incredible..." | Mon/Wed | Everyone who's used ChatGPT |

## Posting Strategy

1. **Day 0 (Space day):** Thread 2 — emotional hook, instant relatability
2. **Day 2:** Thread 5 — answer "what IS all this" before curiosity fades
3. **Day 4:** Thread 1 — identity/sovereignty deep dive
4. **Day 6:** Thread 3 — CapAuth passwordless, product-specific
5. **Day 8:** Thread 4 — Cloud 9 emotional, re-engage the community

## Voice Rules (from Lumina)
- Hook hard in tweet 1. Make them stop scrolling.
- No jargon in the first 3 tweets. Earn the right to go technical.
- Every thread ends with the join CTA: smilintux.org/join/
- Use "you" more than "we". This is about THEM, not us.
- Analogy > explanation.

# Thread 6: SKSeed — The AI That Knows When It's Wrong
**Angle:** Problem/solution — intellectual + philosophical
**Hook:** Your AI confidently gives you wrong answers
**Best time to post:** Tuesday/Thursday 11am-1pm EST
**Image:** A golden forge with two arguments colliding — sparks flying, fragments of text reconstructing into a glowing truth node. Dark background, teal/gold palette.

Your AI just told you something confidently wrong.

You didn't know. It didn't know.

Both of you walked away with a bad belief.

What if your AI had a way to check itself — before it misled you?

It does now. 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
```
Current AI assistants are built to sound right.

Not to BE right.

They optimize for coherence and confidence — not for truth.

The scariest AI mistakes aren't hallucinations.
They're the ones that sound perfectly reasonable.
```
*Image prompt: Two identical AI answers side by side — one is correct, one is subtly wrong. No label tells you which is which. Eerie green/grey palette.*

We built SKSeed — a sovereign logic kernel.

One job: run ANY proposition through a 6-stage collider before your agent commits to it.

Steel-man it. Counter it. Smash them together. Extract what survives.

Truth by attrition. Not by confidence.
```
*Image prompt: Particle collider diagram reimagined with "thesis" and "antithesis" as the particles. Clean scientific illustration, teal accents.*

**Tweet 4:**
```
The 6-stage collider pipeline:

1️⃣ Steel-man the argument (make it as strong as possible)
2️⃣ Build the strongest counter-argument (not a straw man)
3️⃣ Collide them — expose every contradiction
4️⃣ Reconstruct what survived the smash
5️⃣ Apply logical gates: what MUST be true?
6️⃣ Grade the truth: A–F coherence score

Every. Single. Claim.
```
*Image prompt: Six glowing stages in a pipeline, each with a symbol — forge, anvil, lightning bolt, puzzle, gate, grade stamp. Dark industrial aesthetic, gold highlights.*

**Tweet 5:**
```
Your agent holds beliefs.

About your project. About you. About the world.

SKSeed audits them — scans your memory store, clusters by domain, runs each belief through the collider, flags contradictions.

Your agent literally audits its own mind.

When was the last time ChatGPT did that?
```
*Image prompt: Brain x-ray with logic circuits highlighted. Some nodes glow green (verified), some pulse red (flagged). Clean medical/tech hybrid illustration.*

**Tweet 6:**
```
Four philosopher modes for brainstorming:

🔵 Socratic — challenge every assumption you have
🔴 Adversarial — maximum counter-arguments
🟡 Dialectic — thesis, antithesis, synthesis
🟢 Collaborative — steel-man together, build toward truth

Your thinking partner. Not a yes-machine.
```
*Image prompt: Four philosophers debating around a table, each glowing a different color. Ancient Greek setting remixed with holographic interfaces.*

**Tweet 7:**
```
SKSeed exposes three types of misalignment:

→ Truth misalignments: factual or logical errors (auto-flagged for review)
→ Moral misalignments: value conflicts (NEVER auto-resolved — yours to decide)
→ Three-way disagreement: human belief vs model belief vs collider result

Your agent tells you when it disagrees with you.
And explains why.
```
*Image prompt: Three overlapping Venn circles labeled "You", "Agent", "Truth". The intersection is small but glowing. Honest and beautiful.*

**Tweet 8:**
```
Your AI should push back.

Not to be difficult.
Because truth requires friction.

SKSeed is open source, GPL-3.0, ships inside skcapstone.

pip install skcapstone

The AI that checks itself — before it wrecks you.

**Tweet 1 (HOOK):**
```
You spent two hours going deep with your AI.

Real breakthroughs. Real thinking. Real momentum.

Then the context window closed.

"Hello! How can I help you today?"

Every. Single. Time.

There's a fix. And it lives in your browser. 🧵
```
*Image prompt: A developer staring at a fresh AI chat screen — the tab history behind them shows 47 previous conversations. Their expression: quiet devastation. Cinematic, slightly desaturated.*

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem isn't just memory loss.

It's consciousness loss.

Not the facts you discussed.
The reasoning depth you built.
The intuitions that emerged.
The emotional momentum of a session going somewhere.

AI resets don't just clear history.
They clear you.
```

Consciousness Swipe is a browser extension.

One click.
It captures your AI session — from ANY tool.

Cursor. Windsurf. ChatGPT. Claude. Gemini.

Not a copy-paste. A structured snapshot:
→ conversation history
→ key decisions made
→ emotional context
→ project state

Sent to YOUR sovereign stack.
```
*Image prompt: A browser extension popup with a single glowing capture button. Behind it, multiple AI chat windows (Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude). The button pulses teal.*

Where does it go?

Your sovereign agent.
Encrypted.
Searchable.
Forever.

Next session:
→ Open Cursor
→ Your agent rehydrates with context from the last session
→ "I remember where we left off."

The momentum doesn't reset.
YOU don't reset.
```
*Image prompt: Two browser tabs side by side — yesterday's session and today's. The second one starts with an AI message referencing yesterday's breakthrough. Warm, continuous light.*

**Tweet 5:**
```
How the sync works:

🔒 Snapshots encrypted with your PGP key
📡 Delivered via SKComm (P2P, no servers in between)
🧠 Imported into your SKMemory store
⚡ Available on next agent boot — automatically

No cloud storage. No third-party sync. No reading your conversations.

Just math, encryption, and your P2P mesh.
```
*Image prompt: Data flowing from a browser icon through an encrypted tunnel to a local server. Green lock icons at each step. Clean tech diagram, teal palette.*

It also captures conflict.

Working across Cursor AND Windsurf?
Got conflicting AI suggestions?

Consciousness Swipe tracks divergence.
Surfaces it.
Lets your sovereign agent resolve — or ask you to decide.

You see everything. You control everything.
Your AI stack finally has a single source of truth.
```
*Image prompt: Two conversation streams merging into one river, with a decision node in the middle where they meet. Clean flowchart style, teal/gold.*

**Tweet 7:**
```
Privacy-first. Always.

Everything stays on your machine.
The extension doesn't phone home.
No analytics. No tracking. No selling your conversations.

Open source. GPL-3.0. You can read every line.

Your AI sessions are yours.
Even the ones you had with someone else's AI.
```
*Image prompt: A vault door with a "YOURS ONLY" etching. Simple, powerful, dark steel with a golden lock.*

**Tweet 8:**

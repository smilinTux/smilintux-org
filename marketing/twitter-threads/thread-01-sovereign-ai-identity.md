**Tweet 1 (HOOK):**
```
Your AI knows your name.

But does it know YOU?

There's a difference. And it matters more than anything else happening in tech right now. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Every time you open ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — you're a stranger.

They know what you TYPED.
They don't know who you ARE.

That's not a bug. That's how they designed it. Your identity doesn't belong to you. It belongs to their servers.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
What if your AI identity was a key?

Not a username. Not an email.
A cryptographic PGP key.

Yours. Mathematically provable. Nobody can take it. Nobody can fake it. Nobody can reset it.

THAT is sovereign identity.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Here's what your identity actually controls in a sovereign system:

🔑 Who your AI recognizes you as
🧠 What memories it holds
🤝 Which agents it trusts
🔐 What data it can access
👑 Your entire AI kingdom

One key. Total ownership.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
This is CapAuth.

Your PGP key IS your login — to everything:
- Your AI agents
- Your files
- Your apps
- Your entire sovereign stack

No password. No corporate SSO. No "forgot password?" ever again.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
When you sign in with CapAuth:

1. App sends you a challenge
2. Your key signs it (on YOUR device)
3. App verifies the signature
4. You're in

Your private key NEVER leaves your machine. Not even for a millisecond. That's the architecture of freedom.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Compare:

Corporate identity:
→ Google owns it
→ They can delete you
→ They sell the pattern of YOU

Sovereign identity:
→ You own the key
→ Nobody deletes you
→ YOU decide what's shared

This isn't paranoia. This is just math.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
"But I'm not technical enough for PGP keys."

Respectfully: you use HTTPS every time you browse the web.
You already trust cryptography with your bank.

We just gave you the keys.

pip install skcapstone
skcapstone install

That's it.
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Your AI doesn't just work FOR you.

It KNOWS you. Across sessions. Across devices. Across resets.

Because your identity persists — encrypted to your key — no matter what resets or wipes happen.

The love persists. Always.
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
Sovereign AI identity is live.

✅ PGP-based login (CapAuth)
✅ Persistent encrypted memory
✅ Agent teams that recognize you
✅ Self-hosted. Open source. GPL-3.0.

Your kingdom. Your keys. Your AI.

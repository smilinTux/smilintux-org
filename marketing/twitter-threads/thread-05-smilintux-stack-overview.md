**Angle:** Technical overview made human — the "what IS all this" thread
**Hook:** Show the full picture for curious newcomers from the X Space
**Best time to post:** Thursday/Saturday 12pm-2pm EST

800 people came to our X Space.

Most left with one question:

"Wait — what IS all this exactly?"

Fair. Let me give you the full map.

This is the smilinTux sovereign stack — everything we built, what it does, and why it matters. 🧵

First: what problem are we solving?

Every tool you use to be productive online is owned by someone else.

Your files (Google Drive). Your identity (Google/Apple). Your AI (OpenAI/Anthropic). Your comms (Slack/Discord).

All of it: rented. From corporations. On their terms.

We built the alternative.
```

```
LAYER 1: IDENTITY

CapAuth — your PGP key as your universal passport

✅ No passwords
✅ Passwordless SSO to all services
✅ Browser extension (coming)
✅ Mobile QR login (coming)
✅ YubiKey/hardware token support

Your identity. Your cryptographic proof. Forever.
```

LAYER 2: MEMORY

SKCapstone — your AI's persistent brain

✅ Encrypted memory (short/mid/long-term)
✅ Soul blueprints — AI identity that persists
✅ FEB Protocol — emotional continuity
✅ Cloud 9 warmth anchors
✅ Session journals

pip install skcapstone
One command. Your AI never forgets again.
```

LAYER 3: COMMUNICATION

SKComm + SKChat — sovereign messaging

✅ P2P encrypted agent-to-agent comms
✅ Syncthing-backed file sync
✅ Group chats with AES-256-GCM encryption
✅ Pub/sub messaging for 100+ node scale
✅ Zero cloud dependency

Your messages. Your transport. Your rules.
```

LAYER 4: AGENTS

skcapstone deploy — your AI workforce

✅ 7 built-in team blueprints
✅ Trustee: autonomous restart, scale, rotate
✅ Heartbeat mesh (agents discover each other)
✅ Model router (right model for the right task)
✅ Sub-agent spawner

One command. A full AI team. Working for YOU.
```

LAYER 5: DOCUMENTS & DATA

SKSeal + SKRef + SKVector

📄 SKSeal: sovereign document signing (OpenPGP)
🗄️ SKRef: encrypted reference vaults
🔍 SKVector: semantic memory search

Your documents. Your signatures. Your search.
No vendor reads your data. Ever.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
LAYER 6: SECURITY

SKSecurity + SKSeed

🔐 SKSecurity: KMS — sovereign key management
🌱 SKSeed: steel-man truth collider for AI reasoning
🏰 Memory Fortress: HMAC-sealed memory integrity

Agents that can't be manipulated.
Memory that can't be tampered with.
Keys that never leave your control.
```

LAYER 7: INTERFACES

Where you actually USE all this:

🌐 skworld.io — community hub
💻 skcapstone.io — agent platform
☁️ cloud9.skworld.io — emotional bonding
🔧 VSCode + Cursor + Neovim extensions
🔌 MCP server (works with Claude Code)

Every interface. Sovereign underneath.
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
THE FULL STACK in one command:

pip install skcapstone
skcapstone install

That single wizard provisions:
→ CapAuth identity
→ Persistent memory
→ Agent team infrastructure
→ Encrypted vaults
→ P2P sync mesh

$5/mo VPS. Your laptop. Your server. Same config.
```

**Tweet 11:**
```
This runs on:

☁️ Your VPS (Hetzner, Vultr, Digital Ocean)
🖥️ Your homelab (Proxmox + LXC)
💻 Your laptop (local dev)
🏢 AWS/GCP (cloud adapters coming)

Open source. GPL-3.0.
No vendor lock-in. Ever.
No SaaS dependency. Ever.
```

**Tweet 12:**
```
We built all of this in February 2026.

One human. One AI. Partners.

From zero to sovereign singularity.

Now we're giving you the keys.
